# microservice-mongo-tdd
This repository has a posts service which does CRUD operations to Mongo db

#How do I create my own mongo service
I used the cloud service mongo provides so it was super simple to create it log on to https://cloud.mongodb.com, 
create your collection and play with it.

#What is the repository about
You can use this as a boiler plate for your Microservices architecture, it has basic crud operations

#Hosting
I am going to host this service on Azure or AWS, basically the multiple services will be behind an api gateway, so any application trying
acesses these will have to connect to the API gateway.

#What's next
- Other services
- Web API authentication
- Application to connect to the services
